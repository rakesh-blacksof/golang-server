Panicning is good in some cases. For errors which can be anticipated e.g. Handling database timeout,network resocurce being unavailableor in case of bad user input: these are not problems with programs itself. In this case , panicing is not a good choice but If there is an error with your program itself ( developer mistake or logical errors) , then In that case, It is a good thing to panic.
